# CO2-Prediction
The aim of this project is to predict monthly CO2 concentration in the atmosphere in ppm (particles per million). Several architectures of rnn (recurrent neural network) have been used. 3 types of networks have been displayed in 3 notebooks LSTM, GRU and stacked LSTM. The LSTM offers the closest predictions.
This measures the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere on a monthly basis from 1958 to present day. This is the greenhouse gas with the highest concentration that accounts for more then 80% of climate change. Other notable gases are methane, ozone, water vapour and nitrogen oxides, but even though they have a far larger warming potential, they have a significantly lower concentration in ppb (particles per billion) while CO2 is measured in ppm or particles per million., For more information on the subject check this link: https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/
